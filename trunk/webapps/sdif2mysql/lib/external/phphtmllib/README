  -=What is it?=-
  ---------------

   phpHtmllib is more than just an html rendering library.
   It now is a complete application development framework.
   At it's core it contains the base set of PHP classes and library functions to
   help facilitate building, debugging, and rendering of XML,
   HTML, XHTML, WAP/WML Documents, and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
   images as well as complex html 'widgets'  .

   It provides a mechanism to output perfectly indented/readable
   tags, and a programmatic API to generating tags on the fly.

   phpHtmlLib now comes with a project generator script that helps
   users get started building new projects with the framework.  Read
   the INSTALL file for more information on using the new project
   generator.

  I would like to personally thank a few good friends of mine
  that have helped me during the development of phpHtmlLib.
  Richard Koreski, HTML guru and Daniel Ceregatti, long time friend.
  Also thanks to my wife Allison for helping me in all the right ways.

  I'd also like to thank the folks at Zend for writing such an excellent engine for PHP.
  PHP is by far the best web language on the planet.

  Oh yah, and thanks Linus!
