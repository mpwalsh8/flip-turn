External projects reside here.  Ideally they would be referenced through
the use of SVN externals but sometimes that isn't possible.  For example,
the ADODB library is managed with CVS so there isn't a way to connect it
as an SVN external.

External Libraries Used by Flip-Turn:
-  ADODB 5.5.1 for PHP 5 - http://adodb.sourceforge.net
-  phpHtmlLib 2.x - http://phphtmllib.sourceforge.net
